    <h1>Competition</h1>
    <p>The primary competition of my site is wikipedia and tank encyclopedia.</p>
    <h2>wikipedia:</h2>
    <p>Wikipedia is a open sorce site that alows any users to use it, editied it, and create new information for it. The problem with this is that not all infromation is reliable. although they have more information and more people to add to that pile of information.</p>
    <h2>tank encyclopedia:</h2>
    <p>the main premise of tank encyclopedia is very similer to wikipedia but only devoted to tanks, this does make the information generaly more reliable but it still suffers from the same problems. one thing that does make it stand out is its use of tank drawings, each tank has a drawing to go with it.</p>
